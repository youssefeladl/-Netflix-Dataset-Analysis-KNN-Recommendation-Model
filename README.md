# Netflix Dataset Analysis with KNN

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset** to extract useful insights and apply a classification model using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

## 🧠 Goal

- Explore and clean the Netflix dataset.
- Perform data visualization to understand trends.
- Build a KNN model to classify or predict based on features like type, country, rating, etc.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Netflix Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
- Contains information about movies and TV shows on Netflix including title, director, country, rating, release year, etc.

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning (null values, duplicates)
2. Feature Engineering
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Building a KNN classification model
5. Evaluating the model using accuracy, confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Example Visualizations

- Count of content by type (Movie vs TV Show)
- Content added per year
- Most frequent genres
- Country-wise distribution

## 🧠 Model Info

- Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Hyperparameters used: `n_neighbors = 5`, distance = Euclidean
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix
